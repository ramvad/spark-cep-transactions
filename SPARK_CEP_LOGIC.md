# Spark CEP Logic for Transaction Fraud Detection

## Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of how the Spark Complex Event Processing (CEP) logic works for detecting suspicious transaction patterns in the fraud detection system. The implementation uses Apache Spark's DataFrame API and SQL window functions to identify potentially fraudulent activities in batch processing mode.

## Architecture

The Spark CEP implementation consists of two main components:

1. **SparkCEPTransactionBatch.java** - Core batch processing logic for fraud detection
2. **SparkCEPTransactionScheduler.java** - Advanced scheduler for automated batch processing

## Data Model

### Transaction Structure
Each transaction contains the following fields:
- `transactionId` - Unique identifier for the transaction
- `userId` - User performing the transaction
- `amount` - Transaction amount
- `timestamp` - When the transaction occurred
- `location` - Geographic location of the transaction

### Sample Data Format (CSV)
```csv
transactionId,userId,amount,timestamp,location
T001,U001,100.0,2023-01-01 10:00:00,New York
T002,U001,200.0,2023-01-01 10:05:00,New York
```

## Fraud Detection Patterns

The system implements several sophisticated fraud detection patterns:

### 1. High-Frequency Transactions
**Pattern**: Multiple transactions by the same user within a short time window
- **Window**: 5-minute sliding window
- **Threshold**: 3 or more transactions
- **Logic**: Uses `count()` window function to count transactions per user per 5-minute window

```sql
SELECT userId, 
       COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
       MIN(timestamp) as window_start,
       MAX(timestamp) as window_end
FROM transactions
WHERE window_function(timestamp, "5 minutes") 
GROUP BY userId, window
HAVING transaction_count >= 3
```

### 2. Large Transaction Amounts
**Pattern**: Transactions exceeding a predefined threshold
- **Threshold**: $1000 or more
- **Logic**: Simple filter condition on transaction amount

```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions 
WHERE amount >= 1000.0
```

### 3. Rapid Location Changes
**Pattern**: Transactions from different locations within a short time frame
- **Window**: 10-minute sliding window
- **Logic**: Detects when a user has transactions from multiple distinct locations within the time window

```sql
SELECT userId,
       COUNT(DISTINCT location) as location_count,
       COLLECT_SET(location) as locations,
       MIN(timestamp) as window_start,
       MAX(timestamp) as window_end
FROM transactions
WHERE window_function(timestamp, "10 minutes")
GROUP BY userId, window
HAVING location_count > 1
```

### 4. Unusual Transaction Amounts
**Pattern**: Transactions that are statistical outliers based on user's historical behavior
- **Logic**: Calculates mean and standard deviation of user's transaction amounts
- **Threshold**: Transactions exceeding 2 standard deviations from the user's mean

```sql
WITH user_stats AS (
  SELECT userId, 
         AVG(amount) as avg_amount,
         STDDEV(amount) as stddev_amount
  FROM transactions 
  GROUP BY userId
)
SELECT t.*, 
       (t.amount - us.avg_amount) / us.stddev_amount as z_score
FROM transactions t
JOIN user_stats us ON t.userId = us.userId
WHERE ABS((t.amount - us.avg_amount) / us.stddev_amount) > 2.0
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Window Functions
The system extensively uses Spark SQL window functions for time-based pattern detection:

```java
// 5-minute sliding window for high-frequency detection
WindowSpec window5Min = Window
    .partitionBy("userId")
    .orderBy("timestamp")
    .rangeBetween(-300, 0); // 5 minutes in seconds

Dataset<Row> highFreqTransactions = transactions
    .withColumn("transaction_count", 
        functions.count("*").over(window5Min))
    .filter(col("transaction_count").geq(3));
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Load transaction data from CSV files
2. **Data Validation**: Check for required fields and data quality
3. **Pattern Detection**: Apply fraud detection algorithms
4. **Alert Generation**: Create structured alerts for suspicious activities
5. **Output Generation**: Write results to logs and files

### Performance Optimizations

- **Partitioning**: Data is partitioned by userId for efficient processing
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed datasets are cached in memory
- **Broadcast Joins**: Small lookup tables are broadcast for efficient joins
- **Column Pruning**: Only necessary columns are selected to reduce memory usage

## Alert System

### Alert Structure
Each fraud alert contains:
- Alert ID
- Transaction details
- Pattern type detected
- Risk score
- Timestamp of detection

### Alert Categories
1. **HIGH_FREQUENCY** - Rapid transaction patterns
2. **LARGE_AMOUNT** - Unusually large transactions
3. **LOCATION_ANOMALY** - Impossible travel patterns
4. **STATISTICAL_OUTLIER** - Unusual spending behavior

## Configuration Parameters

### Configurable Thresholds
- `HIGH_FREQUENCY_THRESHOLD` - Number of transactions triggering high-frequency alert (default: 3)
- `HIGH_FREQUENCY_WINDOW_MINUTES` - Time window for high-frequency detection (default: 5)
- `LARGE_AMOUNT_THRESHOLD` - Amount threshold for large transaction alerts (default: 1000.0)
- `LOCATION_CHANGE_WINDOW_MINUTES` - Time window for location change detection (default: 10)
- `STATISTICAL_OUTLIER_THRESHOLD` - Z-score threshold for statistical outliers (default: 2.0)

### System Configuration
- `BATCH_SIZE` - Number of records processed in each batch
- `CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` - Frequency of checkpoint creation
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging verbosity level

## Execution Flow

### Batch Processing Steps
1. **Initialization**: Configure Spark session and logging
2. **Data Loading**: Read transaction data from input sources
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and validate transaction data
4. **Pattern Analysis**: Apply fraud detection algorithms
5. **Alert Generation**: Create and format fraud alerts
6. **Result Output**: Write alerts to logs and output files
7. **Cleanup**: Release resources and update checkpoints

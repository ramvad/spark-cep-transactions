# Spark CEP Transaction Detector

A production-ready batch processing solution for detecting fraudulent transaction patterns using Apache Spark.

## 🎯 What This Does

Detects suspicious transaction patterns by identifying:
- **3 or more transactions** from the same account
- **Within a 1-hour time window**
- **Total amount exceeding $1000**

## ✨ Why Batch Processing?

This project demonstrates that **batch processing is often superior to streaming** for fraud detection:

| Advantage | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| **Simplicity** | Single Java class, easy to understand and maintain |
| **Reliability** | Proven approach with comprehensive error handling |
| **Windows Support** | Works perfectly on Windows without Hadoop setup |
| **Cost-Effective** | Run only when needed, not 24/7 |
| **Near Real-Time** | 15-minute intervals provide excellent fraud detection |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven 3.6+

### Option 1: Interactive Menu (Recommended)
```cmd
run-batch.bat
```
Provides a user-friendly menu with all options.

### Option 2: Maven Execution
```cmd
run-maven.bat
```
Simple Maven-based execution.

### Option 3: Manual
```cmd
mvn clean package
mvn exec:java
```

## 📊 Sample Results

**Console Output:**
```
=== SPARK CEP BATCH PROCESSING ===
Processing 15 transactions...

🚨 FRAUD ALERT: Account acct1 - 3 transactions totaling $1,050.00
🚨 FRAUD ALERT: Account acct2 - 3 transactions totaling $1,250.00
🚨 FRAUD ALERT: Account acct4 - 3 transactions totaling $1,200.00

✅ Analysis complete in 8.2 seconds
```

**Detailed Log Files:** Each run creates `spark-cep-batch-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.log` with:
- Complete transaction data
- Pattern analysis steps
- Detailed fraud alerts
- Processing statistics

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components
- **SparkCEPTransactionBatch.java** - Main fraud detection engine
- **SparkCEPTransactionScheduler.java** - Advanced scheduler with incremental processing
- **transactions.csv** - Sample transaction data
- **Comprehensive logging** - Full audit trail

### CEP Implementation
Uses Spark SQL window functions for pattern detection:
```sql
SELECT accountId, COUNT(*) as txCount, SUM(amount) as totalAmount
FROM transactions 
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN window_start AND window_end
GROUP BY accountId, window(timestamp, '1 hour')
HAVING txCount >= 3 AND totalAmount > 1000
```

## 🖥️ Windows Compatibility

Includes specific configurations for seamless Windows operation:
- No HADOOP_HOME required
- Automatic directory creation (`C:/tmp/spark-warehouse`, `./checkpoints`)
- Native library compatibility settings
- Proper JVM module access for Java 17

## 📈 Production Deployment

### Recommended Schedule
For production fraud monitoring, run every **15-30 minutes**:

**Windows Task Scheduler:**
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task → Daily
3. Set "Repeat task every: 15 minutes"
4. Action: Start program → `run-batch.bat`

**Benefits:**
- Near real-time fraud detection
- Simple, reliable infrastructure
- Easy monitoring and troubleshooting
- Comprehensive audit logging

## 🔧 Configuration

### Detection Thresholds
Modify in `SparkCEPTransactionBatch.java`:
```java
// Adjust these values for your requirements:
.filter(col("transactionCount").geq(3))        // 3+ transactions
.and(col("totalAmount").gt(1000))              // >$1000 total
window(col("timestamp"), "1 hour")             // 1-hour window
```

### Data Sources
- Current: `transactions.csv`
- Easy to modify for database connections
- Supports any Spark-compatible data source
